Empathy
As someone who has worked hard to succeed in school, I understand the problem that a student is facing because I have probably gone through it myself. 

Curiosity
My goal is not for clients to leave with memorized knowledge that they will forget anyway. I instead strive to give them an understanding that not only improves their academic performance, but sparks a curiosity in the subject that makes it exciting to learn.

Flexibility
I can teach in person or online. Whenever you need help, I'll try my best to make time for you.

Price
Many schools promise results in exchange for a hafty price tag but often fail to keep their end of the bargain. With me, you will receive personal, high-quality service for a low price.
